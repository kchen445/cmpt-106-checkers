Instructions for building on Unix machines

                          *** IMPORTANT ***

This project uses g++ as a compiler and c++ 14 as the language version.

All build commands should be run from the project root directory. Failing
to do so will result in runtime exceptions to do with errors when looking
for files and directories.

Due to the complexity of the project layout, successful compilation and
execution is only guaranteed on Unix based operating systems. This
includes the Linux subsystem for Windows 10.



To build the game executable, run command:

    $ make game

To run the game executable, run executable:

    $ ./bin/game


To build the training system, run command:

    $ make train

To run the training system, run following command sequence:

    $ cd bin; ./train
    (Note that the 'train' executable must be run from within the bin/ directory)


Other useful commands:

To remove all compiled binary files, run command:

    $ make purge
