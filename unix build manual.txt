Instructions for building on unix machines

From the project root directory, you may have to run this command to
make the shell script for extracting dependecies executable.

    $ chmod a+x ./scripts/dep.sh

If you get an error saying something like dep.sh is not executable then
run the above command to make it executable. Whether this will happen or
not I don't know.


Executables and archives may be built either from the local makefiles
in the repective directory or from the master makefile located in the
project root directory. Archives are placed in the /lib/ drirectory
located in the project root and executables are placed in the /bin/
directory.

NOTE: Archives and executables will difinatly NOT run on Windows
      (they may if you run them through a Linux subsystem).

Archives/Libraries:

    imlib.a: archive for the internal messaging system.
        location: /lib/imlib.a

        master build command:
            $ make imlib.a

        local build command: (from /core/im/)
            $ make lib

    ailib.a: archive for the nerual framework
        location: /lib/ailib.a

        master build command:
            $ make ailib.a

        local build command: (from /ai/)
            $ make lib


Debug Executables:

    imexe: executable for testing the internal messaging system
        location: /bin/imexe

        dependent on: 
            imlib.a

        master build command:
            $ make imexe

        local build command: (from /core/im/)
            $ make exe

    aiexe: executable for testing the nerual framework
        location: /bin/aiexe

        dependent on:
            imlib.a

        master build command:
            $ make aiexe

        local build command: (from /ai/)
            $ make exe
